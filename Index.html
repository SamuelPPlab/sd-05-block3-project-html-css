        Unidentified hackers appear to have been responsible for the massive
        leak of The Last of Us Part 2 months ahead of the game’s release,
        according to multiple reports. Those hackers reportedly gained access to
        files relating to The Last of Us Part 2 by exploiting a vulnerability in
        previous games developed by Naughty Dog.
      </p>
      <p>
        In late April, key, spoiler-filled plot points and level details from
        The Last of Us Part 2 were posted to YouTube, revealing much of the
        story from Naughty Dog’s upcoming PlayStation 4 game. A statement from
        Sony Interactive Entertainment said that the persons responsible for
        that leak were not affiliated with Naughty Dog or SIE.

        <li>Shocking spoiler details</li>
        <p>
          Plot leaks reveal that you only play halfway through the game as the
          beloved characters from the original, a fact that always upsets gamers
          since Metal Gear Solid 2
        </p>
        <li>Alleged change in tone of the original series</li>
        <p>
          Game enthusiasts have also been commenting on a apparent change in the
          core atmosphere of the game, due to new characters, and a change of
          focus from the original main characters.

      <ol>
        <li>The game hasn't come out yet</li>
        <p>
          theres no way to confirm if these story leaks actually have a negative
          impact on the game. Given Naughty Dog’s track record there must be a
          great reason for all plot elements involved.
        </p>
        <li>Naughty Dog is trying to do something different</li>
        <p>
          By focusing more on female protagonists, the company is trying to fill
          a gap that currently exists, and a lack of female role models in the
          medium for a traditionally "gatekeeped industry"
        </p>
        <li>
          Most of the outrage comes from an already established trait of the
          protagonist.
        </li>
        <p>
          A big deal of what alleged fans are outraged revolves around the
          bigger focus of Ellie and her sexuality. A trait previously
          established in the original game and "DLC".
